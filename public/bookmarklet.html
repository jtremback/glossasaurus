      <b class="cap">Looking</b> back to all that has occurred to me since that
      eventful day, I am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my
      adventures. They were truly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered
      when I think of them.

      My uncle was a German, having married my mother’s sister, an
      Englishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he
      invited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home
      was in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,
      geology, mineralogy, and many other ologies.

      One day, after passing some hours in the laboratory—my uncle being absent
      at the time—I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the
      tissues—<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old
      French cook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the
      street door, and came rushing upstairs.
